# Meteor-Phaser
Wrapper around Phaser to make it usable in Meteor. I try to keep this wrapper updated to latest phaser's version. Feel free to create an issue in case I might have forgotten!

## Disclaimer
This is just a wrapper for [Phaser][1]. All credits for [Phaser's development][2] go to the [Phaser Dev Team & Contributors][3]!
[All Phaser's source code is available here][2].

## Current version
2.6.2
